# One-Month Go Learning Plan with Programming and Infrastructure

This plan is designed for 4 weeks of focused learning (~6 hours/day) covering imperative programming, structured programming, algorithms, Go development, and basic infrastructure (networking & security).

## WEEKLY PLAN

### Week 1: Foundations

	• Imperative vs Structured Programming concepts
	• Go syntax: variables, control structures, functions
---
	• Build simple CLI apps (e.g., calculator, to-do list)
---
### Week 2: Algorithms & Go

	• Learn algorithms: sorting, searching, recursion
	• Big-O notation basics
	• Go arrays, slices, maps, structs, interfaces
---
	• Projects: Implement sorting/searching in Go
---
### Week 3: Network & Security

	• Network basics: IPs, ports, protocols (HTTP, TCP, DNS)
	• Security basics: CIA triad, HTTPS, hashing
	• Learn Go net/http package
---
	• Projects: TCP/HTTP server, basic auth
---
### Week 4: Projects + Review

	• Build full Go project (e.g., secure REST API, chat app)
	• Integrate networking and security
	• Daily review: Go, algorithms, infrastructure

## Daily Schedule (6 hours/day)

	Time Block			Focus Area

1 hour					Imperative / Structured Programming (Week 1 only)
1.5 hours				Go Language Learning
1.5 hours				Algorithms (learning + coding problems) (Week 2)
1 hour					Networking / Security (week 3)
1 hour					Go Project Work (apply what you're learning)


---


## Tips for Success

	• Use flashcards for security/networking concepts. - get sticky notes
	• Solve at least 1–2 algorithms daily (e.g., LeetCode, Exercism).
	• Join Go communities (Reddit, Go Slack) for support.
	• Document your learning in GitHub or a blog.
	• Use weekends for deep project work or review.
